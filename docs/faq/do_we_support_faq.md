## ...RDSH apps on appstack?

Yes, as computer based assignments
 
Once apps are assigned and attached to RDSH virtual machine they can be published the same as natively installed apps
 
But what we are wanting to do with RDSH in Astro eventually is make that more seamless. Right now it is two unrelated flows: assign apps to RDSH VMs (probably by Active Directory organizational unit) and then publish apps. This could be one flow that when choosing to publish apps you can choose natively installed apps or App Volumes apps and if you choose an App Volumes app then we will attach that AppStack to the RDSH VMs
