# Manager Log Information

## Types

There are three main logs output by the Manager.

- Application server logs (Ruby on Rails) 
- HTTP server logs (Nginx)
- Service logs (STDOUT from launcher process)

## Application server logs (Ruby on Rails)

### Line sources

Lines in this log come from a few different sources. Request logs, background job logs, and power-watcher logs.

### Process and Request numbers

Each log line starts begins with a timestamp and a process/request identifier. This identifier can be used to correlate log messages for a request. This is especially important when multiple requests happen at the same time and their log messages become intertwined.

For example, the line below came from the server process "2282" and is the 6th request to be received on that process.

    [2016-01-13 06:58:03 UTC]     P22823R6  INFO Started GET "/login" for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-01-12 22:58:03 -0800
    
You can tell a log was generated by a background-job or the power-watcher by looking for "DJ" or "PW" in the request identifier.

Background job:

    [2016-01-13 06:58:25 UTC]  P22851DJ244  INFO        Cvo: Refreshing attachments
    
Power-watcher:

    [2016-01-13 07:21:15 UTC]     P22827PW DEBUG        Cvo: [PowerWatcher] Watching power state changes for 1 machine managers
